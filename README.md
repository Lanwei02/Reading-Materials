* Some algorithms useful for anamaly detection:  
  * K-means(Distance between the nearest centrality); 
  * Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection([The idea behind the isolation forest method](https://quantdare.com/isolation-forest-algorithm/));
  * OneClassSVM([How does it works?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/99162/what-is-one-class-svm-and-how-does-it-work));
  * Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Distribution(Assume that data are normally distributed).
